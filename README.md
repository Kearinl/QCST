# Quantum Cognitive Synthesis Theory (QCST)

## Overview

**Quantum Cognitive Synthesis Theory (QCST)** is an innovative framework that integrates concepts from quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. This theory proposes that consciousness and cognitive processes can be modeled through quantum computations occurring in microtubules within brain neurons. By leveraging these principles, QCST aims to develop artificial intelligence systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions in a manner reminiscent of human cognition.

## Key Concepts

1. **Quantum Computations**: The algorithm simulates quantum computations that process information as superpositions of multiple possibilities, drawing parallels to how human cognition might operate.

2. **Microtubule Dynamics**: QCST explores the role of microtubules in neural functions and their orchestration of quantum processes that contribute to moments of conscious awareness.

3. **Learning and Adaptation**: The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning mechanism that allows the AI to learn from experiences and refine its decision-making processes over time.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: An event-driven design enables real-time responsiveness to conscious moments and external stimuli, mimicking human-like processing of information.

5. **Emergent Behavior**: QCST encourages the development of AI systems that exhibit emergent behavior, capable of adapting and evolving based on interactions with their environment.

## Vibration Frequency Options

In the QCST framework, you have the flexibility to choose the vibration frequency based on your project goals. Here are two options:

1. **Natural Alignment**: Set the vibration frequency to **7.83 Hz** to connect to Earth's natural resonance, also known as the Schumann resonance.
   ```csharp
   public float vibrationFrequency = 7.83f; // Frequency of quantum vibrations in Hz
   ```

2. **Energetic State**: Alternatively, you can keep the vibration frequency at **40.0 Hz** to model a more complex or energetic aspect of quantum computations.
   ```csharp
   public float vibrationFrequency = 40.0f; // Frequency of quantum vibrations in Hz
   ```

Choose the option that best fits the thematic direction of your project and the phenomena you wish to simulate.

## Implementation

The QCST algorithm is implemented in C# and can be utilized within Unity 3D. It also incorporates a MySQL database for storing and accessing learned experiences. The project includes the following components:

- **Quantum Cognitive Simulation**: A Unity script that simulates quantum computations and their impact on neural functions.
- **MySQL Database Setup**: SQL scripts to create and manage a local MySQL database for storing learned data.
- **Learning Mechanism**: Reinforcement learning components that allow the AI to adapt and improve its performance over time.

## Getting Started

To use the QCST framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
